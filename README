Two shell scripts which allow you to access the internet from your BeagleBone
Black, using the USB connection to a host computer.

The script "hostComputer/beaglebone.sh" should be run as root on the host
computer (after having configured the --out-interface to your network device).

After that is run, the script under the beaglebone folder should be run as root
on the BBB.
